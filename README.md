This application connects to the pokemontcg.io API and returns requested information to the user. 
You can request to see how many times a choosen Pokemon has appeared on cards. 
As well as the rarity breakdown (common, uncommon, rare, etc.) of those cards for Pokemon.
I also added a little rock paper scissors game that has a Pokemon theme to it. 

This application relies on the: random, requests and time libraries in order to function. 
I hope that you enjoy using my application today, please email me any questions at:
